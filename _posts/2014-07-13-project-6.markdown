description: The dataset covers a mortality range from 86M to 105M deaths per year (or per 100,000 people). The highest recorded death rate was in Mali/1970, while the lowest was in Japan/2010. Mortality is highest among 0 to 6 days, contributing to 62% of total deaths. Infant mortality (ages 0-5) and elderly mortality (65+) show distinct trends, often linked to healthcare quality and disease prevalence. The total number of deaths has increased by 8% from 1970 to 210. Regional trends indicate that India experiences consistently high mortality, often due to poverty, conflict, lack of healthcare access.

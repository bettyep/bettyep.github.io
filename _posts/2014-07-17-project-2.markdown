description: Most of those who leave the bank have been customers for less than a year, their estimated salary is equal to the balance on their bank statement. The age group most likely to leave is 41-50 years old. France has the highest client amount, but this does not mean a better balance. German accounts(Salary: 101K) have the highest balances, doubling those of France and Spain(Salary: 99K), although the average salary is practically the same(Salary: Germany 101K, France 100K, Spain 99K)..
